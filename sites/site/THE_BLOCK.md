I have always loved writing and poetry. I wrote my first
poetic piece when I was 12 years old in 8th grade and though
I do not remember much of it what I do remember is that I
was so proud of my work I wanted to share it with others.

In 2016 I opened a Wattpad account and instantly fell in
love, the platform itself overflowing with inspired work, it
felt like home.
I would go on to publish a few works on the platform before
I would inevitably type my last words;

> Writing resumes.

What followed was the worst writer's block I have ever
experienced to date. Looking back at my old work I am
overcome by sadness, sadness that at some point I felt so
inspired to start something and along the way, despite my
ever-present zeal, the pages before me remained a blank,
honest representation of my mind.
